# Firebase Shared Drawing

This iOS app demonstrates the use of the [Firebase SDK](https://firebase.com/) to create a shared drawing
canvas. Multiple users can run the app and draw on the same canvas. Line segments are synchronized as the user draws them. It is compatible with the [Android drawing app](https://github.com/firebase/AndroidDrawing/).

This example is intended to demonstrate how you can adapt single-user applications to be collaborative with the help of Firebase. Create your own [Firebase](https://firebase.com/) and incorporate these techniques into your own application!
